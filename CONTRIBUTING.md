## Policies, Requirements, and Guidelines for Contributors and Contributions

### Developer Certificate of Origin

Contributors must, with their first commit and/or PR to the project, include a statement explicitly
acknowledging their understanding and acceptance of the Developer Certificate of Origin, available
in the `/docs/agreements/DCO.txt` file. The commit message must also contain the contents of this
file verbatim.
